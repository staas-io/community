# Introduction
Complete this tutorial to deploy a sample PHP FastAPI app to Staas.

Requirements:
- A verified Staas.io account.
<!-- -->
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) installed. If you don't have Git installed, please complete the guides before proceeding:
    - [Git installation](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
    - [First-time setup](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup)


## Creating your first Stack with Staas.io

### Instance Creation
Staas.io gives you more controls with the instance you run your app on.

Go to your [Staas.io Dashboard](https://www.staas.io/dashboard?utm_source=docs)
![](../../assets/images/getting-started/nodejs-staas-dashboard.png)

Click on [Create new stack +](){: .btn .btn-purple .ml-2 .mr-2 }.
From this screen, you can select your stack of choice including Programming Languages, Databases and Applications. In this tutorial, we'll select PHP.
![](../../assets/images/getting-started/php-select-php.png)

In the Create Stack page, configure your stack:
- **Stack name**: This is your stack name. It is also the name of your web domain once the stack is created.
- **Owner**: Set it as a private or a shared stack so that your team can contribute and maintain.
- **Type**: This is The stack type. It is the same as the previous page. In this case, PHP is already selected.
- **Version**: Select a PHP's version. Let's select PHP 7.4 for our example.
- **Packages**: This is your instance type. Choose your desired hardware's capability. The options are limited to your [Pricing plan](https://www.staas.io/#pricing).
- **Region**: Choose a region to deploy your stack. The app should be deployed closest to your target customers.
![](../../assets/images/getting-started/php-create-php-screen.png)

Press Create and your stack will be created momentarily. An email will be sent to you once it is created and ready to run.

### Manage your Stack in the Dashboard
Once you created the stack, you will be greeted with a Stack Management screen.

![](../../assets/images/getting-started/php-stack-screen.png)

In this screen, you can pretty much control everything regarding to your stack/instance with just a few mouse clicks.

Checking out your new domain by clicking on [Domain](){: .btn .btn-purple .ml-2 .mr-2 } button. It will open up your designated domain in a new tab. For now, it is just a basic page with a "Hello World, This Is STAAS!" message.

## Set up the App

**â†’ Method 1: Using Git**

### Setting up SSH key

You must setup your SSH key with your account in order to push to your Staas.io remote. This process is done once and it will be associcated with your account.

Please read [SSH Keys]({% link docs/ssh-keys.md %}) page to learn how to create your SSH key.

Now go to your Stass.io [Profile](https://www.staas.io/dashboard/profile) page. In the Security section at the bottom, paste your SSH public key in the "New RSA public key with valid format" input box and press Add.
![](../../assets/images/getting-started/staas-profile-add-ssh-key.png)

Now you can select your public key in the "Public keys" dropdown just above.

That's it for the SSH key setup. You can now push your code to your Staas.io's remote.

### Deploying the app
Clone the sample FastAPI app that Staas had prepared for you. Execute these in your local terminal:
```
$ git clone git@git.staas.io:pyltk1998/phpdoyouloveme.git -o staas
$ cd phpdoyouloveme
```

Now back to the dashboard.

Click on the [GIT](){: .btn .btn-purple .ml-2 } button, you will see a Git remote URI and some instructions on how to deploy the code to your stack instance. Git remotes are versions of your repository that live on other servers. You deploy your app by pushing its code to that Staas remote associated with your app.
![](../../assets/images/getting-started/nodejs-git-button.png)

Here's how to do it with this repo:
- Set a new remote to the repo, remember to replace the remomte URI with yours URI:
```
# git remote add staas <your_remote_URI>
$ git remote add staas git@git.staas.io:pyltk1998/phpdoyouloveme.git
```

- To deploy this to Staas, simply run this command to push the `master` branch of the repo to your Staas remote (one for master branch, then to copy over to deploy branch). Staas will automatically deploy your app:

```shell
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "<your-massage>"
$ git push -f staas master

**â†’ Method 2: Using Filemanager**

On the `Stack Management` screen, scroll down to see the `Operation` section, here you check `I understand that reveal this sensitive information might unintentionally leak the security of my stacks`, you will see the Enviroment information (this is important information, please manage it carefully). You find information such as `FILEMANAGER_DOMAIN`, password `FILEMANAGER_PASSWORD` and username `FILEMANAGER_USERNAME` (these are information for you to control Filemanager).
You can learn more about [Common Variables on Staas.io](https://docs.staas.io/docs/the-basics/enviroment.html#common-variables-on-staasio)

![](../../assets/images/getting-started/php-stack-screen-operation.png)

Please access the path `FILEMANAGER_DOMAIN` with username and password, be provided. Then you proceed to upload your website source code to the "data" folder.

![](../../assets/images/getting-started/php-filemanager-screen.png)

The application is deployed. You can visit the app by clicking [Domain](){: .btn .btn-purple .ml-2 .mr-2 } on the dashboard.

Congratulations, you have successfully deployed a PHP app with Staas.io.
